# Quera Bootcamp - Django

This is a educational purpose project for Quera Bootcamp.
I used this for a talk to show how to use Django.

## How to install

Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install poetry and run `poetry install` to install dependencies.

### For Development
Install pre-commit and run `pre-commit install` to install pre-commit hooks.

## How to run it

Run `./manage.py runserver` to run the project.
